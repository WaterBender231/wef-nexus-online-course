Vörösmarty et al. (2010) assessed human water security (HWS) and threats to biodiversity (BD). Drivers are the geographical representation of distinct stressors, and were selected to meet two requirements. First, drivers for which global-scale data sets of appropriate spatial resolution were either already available or could be generated in a defensible way from existing data were selected. And second, drivers whose chief mechanism of negatively impacting freshwaters was largely independent of the other drivers. A three-step procedure was used to convert driver values into standardized driver scores in order to calculate aggregate HWS and BD Threat indices. This conversion process allowed to account for downstream propagation of threats, normalize for longitudinal changes in discharge, and express all drivers on a common scale. 

Four different themes were defined and for each theme important stressors identified (in total 23 stressors). The list is presented below with the respective weight in brackets: 
- Catchment disturbance (0.18): (i) cropland (0.38); (ii) impervious surfaces (0.28); (iii) livestock density (0.20); (iv) wetland disconnectivity (0.14)
- Pollution (0.35): (i) soil salinization (0.13); (ii) nitrogen loading (0.14); (iii) phosphorus loading (0.13); (iv) mercury deposition (0.13); (v) pesticide loading (0.15); (vi) sediment loading (0.07); (vii) organic loading (0.18); (viii) potential acidification (0.05); (ix) thermal alteration (0.02)
- Water resources development (0.41): (i) dam density (0.09), (ii) river fragmentation (0.03); (iii) consumptive water loss (0.34); (iv) human water stress (0.26); (v) agricultural water stress (0.19); (vi) flow disruption (0.09)
- Biotic factors (0.06): (i) non-native fishes in % (0.13); (ii) non-native fishes in # (0.14); (iii) fishing pressure (0.27); (iv) aquaculture pressure (0.46)

The ADB (2013) applied a framework looking at five dimensions to assess national water security. The methodology has been applied for all Asian countries and here the main dimensions and indicators are presented. The scale used for national water security goes from 1 to 5 using the following qualitative interpretation: 1 = hazardous, 2 = engaged, 3 = capable, 4 = effective, 5 = model-

The key dimensions (KD) are listed below:
- KD1: Household water security
Indicators: (i) access to piped water supply (%), (ii) access to improved sanitation (%), (iii) hygiene (age-standardized disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people for the incidence of diarrhea.

- KD2: Economic water security
Agricultural water security subindex: (i) productivity of irrigated agriculture, (ii) independence from imported water and goods, (iii) resilience (% of renewable water resources stored in large dams).
Industrial water security subindex: (i) productivity (financial value of industrial goods relative to industrial water withdrawal), (ii) consumption rate (net virtual water consumed relative to water withdrawn from industry.
Energy water security subindex: (i) utilization of total hydropower capacity, (ii) ratio of hydropower to total energy supply.

- KD3: Urban water security
(i) Water supply (%), (ii) wastewater treatment (%), (iii) drainage (measured as the extent of economic damage caused by floods and storms).
Adjustment factors are included to indicate impacts of the urban growth rate and river health

-KD4: Environmental water security
Watershed disturbance: (i) cropland, (ii) imperviousness, (iii) livestock density, (iv) wetland disconnection
Pollution: (i) soil salinization, (ii) nitrogen, (iii) phosphorous, (iv) mercury, (v) pesticides, (vi) total suspended solids, (vii) organic loads, (viii) potential acidification, (ix) thermal impacts from power plant cooling.
Water resources development: (i) dam density, (ii) river network fragmentation, (iii) relative water consumption compared to supply, (iv) agriculture sector water stress, (v) residency time change downstream from dams.
Biotic factors: (i) non-native species, (ii) non-native species richness, (iii) catch pressure, (iv) aquaculture

- KD5: Resilience to water-related disasters
Exposure: e.g. (i) population density, (ii) growth rate.
Basic population vulnerability: e.g. (i) poverty rate, (ii) land use.
Hard coping capacities: e.g. (i) telecommunications development
Soft coping capacities: e.g. (i) literacy rate.
