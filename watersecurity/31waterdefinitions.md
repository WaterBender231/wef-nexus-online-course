## 3.1 **What does “Water Security” mean?**

’’The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of and acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability.’’ (UN Water, 2013)

“… every person has access to enough safe water at affordable cost to lead a clean, healthy and productive life while ensuring the environment is protected and enhanced.” (GWP, 2000)
