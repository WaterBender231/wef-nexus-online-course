# **2.3 Dimensions, indicators, and sources**

For the scope of this learning unit, we selected the dimensions availability, accessibility, safety and quality, and governance. Additionally, we provide you with some easy-to-calculate indicators, literature, and data sources.


## 2.3 Indices to measure water availability

| Dimension
 | Indices | Definition | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | Water scarcity index | WSI is defined as the ratio of total water withdrawal to the water availability including environmental flow requirements. | AQUASTAT
http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en |
|  | Water resources per capita | m¬≥/inhabitant/per year |  |
|  | Long-term average annual precipitation | mm/year |  |

Typically, mean annual precipitation and aridity indices have been used as proxy-values for total availability in data-scarce regions (Dickson et al., 2016). Jensen and Wu (2018) assess the availability by measuring the total water resources per capita (lcd) but also including a dependency variable (imported water/total water resources), which introduces implicitly a political factor. Babel et al. (2020) measures availability with per capita use and imported water (%).

AQUASTAT provides data at national level for the following indicators:
- (i) long-term average annual precipitation (mm);
- (ii) total internal renewable water resources per capita (m¬≥/inhab./year);
- (iii) total external renewable water resources (m¬≥/year);		
- (iv) dependency ratio;
- (v) SDG 6.4.2. water stress (%)

The WSI, water scarcity index, defined as the ratio of total water withdrawal to the water availability considering environmental flow requirements. Water withdrawal includes both surface water and renewable groundwater use for agriculture (irrigation and livestock), industry and households. For assessing hydrological droughts, the monthly 80-percentile flow, Q80, was used (i.e. the mean monthly stream flow that is exceeded 80% of the time accounting for seasonal streamflow variability).

#### **WSI equation**

Where Ww is the water withdrawal and Aw is the water availability. Ew is the environmental flow requirement.
Groundwater depletion, defined as the persistent removal of groundwater from aquifer storage owing to abstraction, has been estimated for the benchmark year 2010 at a 0.5¬∞ grid. Drought frequency was derived by counting the occurrences of drought events, i.e. when stream flow falls below the threshold Q80, and drought index was calculated by dividing drought frequency by the average frequency over the period 1960‚Äì2010.

ADB (2013) follows a different approach which also related water availability with other securities (i.e. energy and food) by introducing the dimension economic water security. Here, indicators such as agricultural independency are introduced as well as agricultural use efficiency, industrial productivity or hydropower dependency. In the example of GWP (2012) the combination of these categories adds up to a overall productive economies index.

#### Exercise: Which indicators best represent the dimension ‚ÄûAvailability ‚Äú in your country/region?
