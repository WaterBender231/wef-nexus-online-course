# 6.4 Policy and Governance Instruments

**Nexus Governance**
**We assume that inter-sectorial Nexus governance would lead to optimised resources management and hence improved overall welfare**

- However,  Nexus governance measures can often not be implemented because of the existing single-sector governance system
- Therefore, a clear policy framework is required that can foster sector integration

**Important questions to ask are:**

- What institution could assume such a task?
- How is it achieved?

The next Learning Unit will introduce you to governance instruments and related case studies.
The following slides summarize some key instruments.
Governance and Response measures to overcome Nexus conflicts and trade-offs should be based on a Nexus assessment
Effective responses require strategic vision, appropriate policies, regulations and an enabling institutional setting
Responses should be designed at the appropriate scale: local, regional, national or transboundary
Selection of potential interventions should be supported by decision-making tools

### 6.4.1 **Policy Framework for Managing the Nexus**

Rasul, 2016

**Important points to consider for a policy framework that addresses the Nexus:**
Horizontal (cross-sectoral) and vertical (between levels of government) coordination is essential.
Institutional relationships are to be considered
The capacities of local government institutions need to be strengthened

**Different types of interventions can be used to manage the Nexus:**
Institutional policies to integrate the Nexus perspective
Economic instruments to align incentives and exploit synergies
Information generation and sharing among sectors to support integration
Investments to exploit win-win opportunities
Capacity development to strengthen institutional capacity

### 6.4.2 **Vertical Coordination**

Coordination between different levels of governance is realised through different institutional instruments.
**For example, through:**

- Dialogue processes and consultations
- Conferences of national and regional ministries (often along sectoral lines)
- Working groups between local-regional-national government levels

Vertical coordination between different levels is realised through various different mechanisms. Those listed on this slide are only some of the examples available (and these examples often also have different names in different national contexts).
**Dialogue processes and consultations can serve as strong mechanism for vertical integration by:**
Building relationships and trust between national and local actors
Clarifying mandates, policies and institutional arrangements
Identifying opportunities and obstacles for the implementation of national development targets and policies at the local level
Facilitating coordinated representation of interests from the local to the national level
