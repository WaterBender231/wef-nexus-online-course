## Introduction
The WEF-Nexus governance may take place at different scales (global, regional, national, local or at farm or household level e.g. when farmers optimize their resources use through implementing adequate technologies). 

The case study “Fertiliser Ordinance Amendment in Germany” demonstrates examples of governance instruments for intersectoral coordination at national scale in Germany. The case study represents two instruments: 

- a procedural instrument: integrated decision-making process at the national level in Germany through Joint Rules of Procedure of the Federal Ministries
AND
- an organizational instrument: working groups of ministries representatives
