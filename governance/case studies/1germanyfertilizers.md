# **6.3.1 Case Study I - Fertiliser Ordinance Amendment in Germany**

<img src="/wef-nexus-online-course/assets/intersectoral_coord_DE.png" alt="Case Study I - Banner"/>


## 1. Introduction
The WEF-Nexus governance may take place at different scales (global, regional, national, local or at farm or household level e.g. when farmers optimize their resources use through implementing adequate technologies). 

The case study “Fertiliser Ordinance Amendment in Germany” demonstrates examples of governance instruments for intersectoral coordination at national scale in Germany. The case study represents two instruments: 

- a procedural instrument: integrated decision-making process at the national level in Germany through Joint Rules of Procedure of the Federal Ministries
AND
- an organizational instrument: working groups of ministries representatives

## 2. Intersectoral coordination in German political processes
### Objective: Explain the intersectoral coordination in German political process

The process takes place in the following order (numbers from 1 to 12 on the diagram): 

Inter-ministerial horizontal coordination: 
1. The lead ministry responsible for a matter (introduction of a new law, plan) must inform other affected ministries about his plans and is 
2. principally responsible for the management of the cooperative work. 
3. Many formal and informal institutions exist that help achieve this coordination between different ministries and disciplines. The main formal institutions for horizontal coordination between the ministries are inter-ministerial committees and working groups. 
4. When disputes arise, the responsible ministry is not permitted to take any binding decisions. Instead, the issue must be negotiated until an agreement is reached. The Federal Government has two functions in this process: It acts in a mediating role if the ministries cannot reach an agreement. Only when all points of conflict are resolved a definitive decision will be taken. 
5. Furthermore, the federal government assumes the responsibility for the overriding coordination of policy
6. Involvement of the federal states and communal organizations (horizontal and vertical coordination):
7. The lead ministry must also involve federal states and communal organizations in the legislative process. 
8. In the first step, the views of federal states and communal organizations must be obtained (GGO, Article 41, 44). 
9. The federal states and communal organizations provide their position statements. 
10. As soon as a draft law is formed, the ministry will present the draft to the states and the communal organizations. 
11. The involvement of experts from scientific and practical backgrounds is stipulated at each level of the legislative process.  


Legal framework: 
The above described intersectoral coordination in the German political process is regulated in the “Joint Rules of Procedure of the Federal Ministries (JRP)”.  

- Public Participation:
While the involvement of federal states, communal organizations and external experts are stipulated as mandatory and are regulated in the JRP, consultations with other stakeholders or civic organisations are not foreseen in the JRP. 

The public involvement is governed by underlying sector related laws, for example by the “Law for the improvement of public involvement and standardisation of planning approval procedures”.

The following tools can be used to involve public participation:
- Organise public meetings and hearings to provide members of the public with the information they need to understand the project and decision process
- Provide the opportunity for the public to submit position statements 
- Create a virtual public space where people can interact, discuss issues and share ideas (e.g. internet platforms)
- Organise round tables and working groups 
- Conduct interviews with relevant stakeholders
