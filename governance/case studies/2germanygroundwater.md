# **6.3.2 Case Study II - Groundwater Management in the Hessian Ried in Germany**

<img src="/wef-nexus-online-course/assets/banner_c2.jpg" alt="Banner - Case II "/>

The case study is an example of the application of following WEF-Nexus coordination instruments: ​
- Communicative instrument: Ground Water Management Plan ​
- Legislative policy instrument: Targeted groundwater extraction values​
- Organizational instrument: Round table discussions ​

## Groundwater recharge

The diagram above summarizes the groundwater recharge: The water from the Rhine River is transported through a pipe system to the water treatment plant in Bibesheim. Though the treatment process in Bibesheim the water obtains drinking water quality. The drinking water quality is required to  avoid groundwater pollution through the groundwater recharge process. After reaching the drinking water quality the water is distributed for the groundwater recharge and for agriculture.

## Groundwater monitoring network in the Hessian Ried

The groundwater level in the Hessian Ried is measured at about 850 monitoring stations.

## Solution: Groundwater Management
### Measured groundwater levels at a station in the Hessian Ried

Based on sixty years of experience in monitoring groundwater levels in the Hessian Ried, the district government defined target values for the groundwater level which are adequate for the environment. The measured values in the monitoring stations and the expected water demand are used to control the groundwater recharge in accordance with the target value.
By water levels below the target value the infiltration takes place. By high levels it doesn´t.           

<hr/>


The round table brought together all relevant stakeholders including:

Regional government authorities
Representatives of different interests (forestry, water suppliers, environmental associations, nature conservation associations, farmer associations, action groups against waterlogging in houses)
Districts, cities and municipalities.






## Background of the case study​

The Hessian Ried, located south of Frankfurt, extends over an area of approximately 1,250 km2​. The landscape is a part of the Upper Rhine Plain, and prior to human intervention was a swamp area and part of the natural inundation zone of the Rhine River.​ Through widespread drainage and agricultural utilisation, the landscape was starkly changed.​

The following user interests are dominant in the area:​
- Agriculture​
- Industry / infrastructure​
- Drinking water use​
- Nature conservation​

<hr/>

## User conflicts 

arise from:​
- Alteration of natural landscapes to cultivated landscapes;​
- Pollution inputs from agriculture;​
- Intensive exploitation of groundwater resources.​

The intensive exploitation refers to the fact that due to the spatial locations of population centres and other geographically-centred points of extraction, the groundwater extraction rates do not match recharge rates over the spatial plain.​

In dry years, considerable damages to infrastructure have been caused by low groundwater levels.​


<hr/>

## Dry years in the Hessian Ried

Extreme dry years in 1970s drastically increased the demand for water - especially for agricultural irrigation. The groundwater dropped to an extremely low level causing:​

- forest dieback,​
- road damages, ​
- failures in agricultural irrigation. ​

​
<hr/>

## Wet years in the Hessian Ried

On the otherside, due to high precipitation in the 2001, in many places the highest groundwater levels in the last 40 years were reached causing waterlogging and flooding.​

<hr/>

## Solution: ​
### The Hessian Ried Groundwater Management Plan –​ legally binding instrument​
​
In face of the unstable groundwater levels, the Hessian State decided to stabilize the groundwater levels. The stabilization is regulated by the Groundwater Management Plan. The main instruments of the plan are: ​


1. Groundwater recharge to ensure water availability for irrigation and drinking water supply.​
2. Groundwater monitoring network with defined targeted groundwater levels.​

</hr>

## Overview: groundwater recharge in the Hessian Ried

The water from the Rhine River is transported through a pipe system to the water treatment plant in Bibesheim.​

Though the treatment process in Bibesheim the water obtains drinking water quality. The drinking water quality is required to  avoid groundwater pollution through the groundwater recharge process.​

After reaching the drinking water quality the water is distributed for the groundwater recharge and for agriculture. ​
