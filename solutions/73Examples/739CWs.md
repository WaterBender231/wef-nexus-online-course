# **7.3.9 Constructed wetlands (CWs)**

## What are constructed wetlands? 

A standard definition of wetlands comes from the **Ramsar Convention** (= Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat):

> [Wetlands are] areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish, or salt including areas of marine water, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed 6 m.

Wetlands have unique hydrologic conditions and are ecotones (= a transition area between two biological communities) between terrestrial and aquatic systems. One of many wetland characteristics is standing water, unique soil conditions, and adapted organisms and vegetation to the saturated soils (Mitsch, 2013). In contrast to natural wetlands, CWs are engineered systems that use natural processes to treat wastewater. Specific wetland elements, such as vegetation, soils, and microbiological organisms, are utilized to treat wastewater (Vymazal, 2010).

## CW Mechanisms - How do CWs work? 

From a technical point of view, scientists classify CWs based on hydrology (free water surface and subsurface flow) or vegetation type (emergent, submerged, floating leaved, free-floating) (Vymazal, 2010; Stefanakis, 2019; Maiga et al., 2017). Subsurface flow wetlands might be further divided based on their flow direction: vertical or horizontal flow CWs (Vymazal, 2010).

# **Application areas of CWs**

1. Habitat creation

2. Flood control

3. Wastewater treatment

Types of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment <small> (Maiga et al., 2017, adapted from Vymazal, 2008) </small>

| **Wetland Type**      | Free Water Surface Flow | Subsurface Flow     |
| **Type of Plants**      | Free-floating, floating-leafed, submerged, emergent | Emergent only |
| **Direction of Flow**   | Horizontal        | Horizontal or Vertical (vertical can be downflow or upflow) |

## Benefits of CWs
<br>
1. creation of new ecological habitats <br>
<br>
2. source of food and fiber <br>
<br>
3. stormwater management    
<br>
4. provides less costly and effective wastewater treatment
