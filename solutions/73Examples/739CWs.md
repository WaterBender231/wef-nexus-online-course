# **7.3.9 Constructed wetlands (CWs)**

## What are constructed wetlands? - Overview

(trends)

<hr/>

## CW Mechanisms - How do CWs work? 

From a technical point of view, scientist classify CWs based on water flow paths as well as the type of vegetaion within the CW (Stefanakis, 2019, Maiga et al., 2017). In this learning unit we address three main types of constructed wetlands (after Maiga et al., 2017): 

1. horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands
2. horizontal free water surface flow constructed wetlands
3. vertical flow constructed wetlands. The table below serves as brief ovreview about the differences in plant type and water flow paths


<hr/>

# **Application areas of CWs**

1. Habitat creation

2. Flood control

3. Wastewater treatment

<b>Types of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment<b> <small> (Maiga et al., 2017, adapted from Vymazal, 2008) </small>

| **Wetland Type**      | Free Water Surface Flow | Subsurface Flow     |
| **Type of Plants**      | Free-floating, floating-leafed, submerged, emergent | Emergent only |
| **Direction of Flow**   | Horizontal        | Horizontal or Vertical (vertical can be downflow or upflow) |



## Benefits of CWs
<br>
1. creation of new ecological habitats <br>
<br>
2. source of food and fiber <br>
<br>
3. stormwater management

<p>
Advantages, <small>Stefanakis, 2019</small> <br>
- reduction in runoff volumes, peak flows and duration <br>
- protection of downstream water resources <br>
- reducing risks of flooding <br>
- reducing  risks associated with combined sewer overflow <br>
- water quality improvement <br>
- enhancement of groundwater recharge/discharge <br>
- increase of runoff infiltration <br>
- sediment stabilization <br>
- <i>co-benefit:</i>creation of wildlife habitat <br>
- options for recreation activities <br>

4. provides less costly and effective wastewater treatment
