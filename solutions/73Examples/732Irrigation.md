Solar-powered irrigation systems (SPIS) combine water pumps, solar generators, irrigation systems and agricultural production (Poompavai & Kowslaya, 2019, energypedia). The solar generator provides electricity to the water pump when solar energy is available, and water is pumped to the water reservoir. A valve controls the irrigation of the crops. The water reservoir acts as indirect energy storage, balancing out the solar generator's fluctuating energy production and, thus, taps WEF synergies. The annual water outtake should not exceed the yearly groundwater renewal to avoid a phreatic decline and ensure an ecosystem-friendly operation.

On [energypedia.info](http://energypedia.info/), a user-friendly toolbox on SPIS can be downloaded. The aim is "to enable advisors, service providers and practitioners in the field of solar irrigation" and " provide broad hands-on guidance to end-users, policy-makers and financiers." The toolbox features calculations sheets, checklists, and guidelines to accompany all system implementation steps from first information to the maintenance of an installed system.
